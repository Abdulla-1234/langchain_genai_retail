# 🧠 AtliQ Tees: Natural Language to SQL with LLM

An end-to-end LLM-powered application that allows users to interact with a MySQL database using natural language. Built using **Google PaLM**, **LangChain**, and **Streamlit**, this system empowers store managers to ask questions about inventory, sales, and discounts without needing SQL knowledge.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**AtliQ Tees** is a T-shirt store offering brands like **Adidas**, **Nike**, **Van Heusen**, and **Levi's**. All product data — including inventory, sales, and discounts — is stored in a MySQL database.

This project builds an intelligent interface where a store manager can ask:

> “How many white Adidas t-shirts do we have left in stock?”

The system translates the question into an SQL query using **LLM** and retrieves the accurate answer from the database.
